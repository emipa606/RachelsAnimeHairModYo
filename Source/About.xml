Included hair styles:
-All Might, from My Hero Academia
-Levi Ackerman, from Attack on Titan
-Yona, from Yona of the Dawn
-Senku, from Dr. Stone (for all your mad scientist needs!)
-Emma, from The Promised Neverland
-plus more!

This mod doesn't overwrite any existing vanilla hairstyles. Includes both the original character hair colors and greyscale options for customization.

I designed these with [Nl] Chibi Face Female Only and [Nl] Chibi Face Male Only in mind (fit best with Average Normal), but many fit well with other faces. (Kakashi's hair, unsurprisingly does not fit well on other face types.)

Recommend using Character Editor or Prepare Carefully to adjust the hair to white, if you want it to look like the OG character. 

More coming soon...
